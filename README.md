# Cpp2-TAMK
Tasks and code from second course of C++ in TAMK. I was aiming to get grade 5 (out of 5) and I was successful.
## First half:

### Round 1 (kierros1):
Playing around with pointers and arrays.

### Round 2 (kierros2):
- teht1: Testing enum.
- teht2: using math.h.
- teht3: playing around with calling function from inside another function
- teht4: basic prime number program

### Round 3 (kierros3):
- teht1: Ask user seconds and convert it to hours, minutes and seconds. (expecting user to use correct inputs)
- teht2: Ask user hours, minutes and seconds and convert it to seconds and back to hours, minutes and seconds. (expecting user to use correct inputs)
- teht3: Playing around with structs and pointers. Ask user hours, minutes and seconds, test if the input is within 24hours and print the time 00:00:00 in two ways. (expecting user to use correct inputs)
- teht4: Asks user to give 2 different times, put them in struct and count subtraction of them. (expecting user to use correct inputs)

### Round 4 (kierros4):
- teht1: Figure out what is max size of array.
- teht2: Fetch data from Random.txt and count and sum fetched ints
- teht3: Write simple html frame into index.html using user input.

## Second half:
- Every file in week6 will work and is upgraded gradually week by week, until all objects make a school set-up (school, course, student, teacher, person, date, address and an extra: dice).
### Week 1-2:
- learn basics how c++ object works
- constructors and destructors
- getters and setters

### Week 3:
- add const to correct places. NOTE: not every file is corrected
- object in object

### Week 4: 
- copy constructor
- using object as a parameter

### Week 5:
- inheritance

### Week 6:
- protected
- virtual methods
- override and virtual functions
